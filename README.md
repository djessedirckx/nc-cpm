# Welcome!

This GitHub page contains an altered version of one of the Artistoo experimental setups. This setup was altered to be changed on the fly with the use of buttons and its main difference is that it introduces a setting with different obstacles for the cells to interact with.

The following files can be found in this repository:
- ActModel.html - The only file that was altered to alter the experimental setup
- artistoo.js - Dependency for ActModel.html
- fpsmeter.min.js - Dependency for ActModel.html
- slider.js - Dependency for ActModel.html
- style.css - Dependency for ActModel.html

In order to use the simulation one should download all files and then open ActModel.html with a modern browser, it was verified that it works in the following browsers: Chrome, Edge and Safari but it might support more browsers aswell.
